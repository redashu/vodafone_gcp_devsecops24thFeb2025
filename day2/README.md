### Service account in GCP 

![Service Account](svc1.png)

### Creating service account 

```sh
gcloud iam service-accounts create ashu-svc-new2 --project=vodafone-devsecops
```

### Task 1

![Task 1](task1.png)

### Adding a predefine role to service account 

```sh
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding vodafone-devsecops --role="roles/compute.viewer" --member="serviceAccount:ashu-svc-new2@vodafone-devsecops.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

### Creating custom role and binding to service account 

```sh
gcloud iam roles create ashuCustomRole --project=vodafone-devsecops --title="compute engine roles permission" --permissions=compute.instances.create,compute.instances.delete,compute.instances.start  

# Bind the custom role to the service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding vodafone-devsecops --role="projects/vodafone-devsecops/roles/ashuCustomRole" --member="serviceAccount:ashu-svc-new2@vodafone-devsecops.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

#### Google Cloud KMS Info 

Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) is a cloud-based service that allows you to manage encryption keys for your Google Cloud services. It provides a centralized way to create, use, rotate, and destroy cryptographic keys, ensuring that your data is securely encrypted both at rest and in transit. Letâ€™s dive deep into Google Cloud KMS, covering its features, use cases, and how to use it effectively.

1. **What is Google Cloud KMS?**  
    Google Cloud KMS is a fully managed service that enables you to:
    - Create and manage cryptographic keys (symmetric and asymmetric).
    - Encrypt and decrypt data using these keys.
    - Integrate with other Google Cloud services (e.g., Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Compute Engine) to encrypt data.
    - Control access to keys using IAM policies.
    - Audit key usage using Cloud Audit Logs.

2. **Key Concepts**  
    a. **Key**  
        A key is a cryptographic object used for encryption, decryption, signing, or verification. Keys can be:
        - **Symmetric:** Same key for encryption and decryption.
        - **Asymmetric:** Consists of a public and private key pair.

    b. **Key Ring**  
        A key ring is a logical grouping of keys. It is used to organize keys and manage access at the key ring level. Key rings are created in a specific location (e.g., global, us-central1).

    c. **CryptoKey**  
        A CryptoKey is a specific key within a key ring. It can be used for encryption, decryption, signing, or verification. CryptoKeys have a purpose:
        - **ENCRYPT_DECRYPT:** For symmetric encryption/decryption.
        - **ASYMMETRIC_SIGN:** For asymmetric signing.
        - **ASYMMETRIC_DECRYPT:** For asymmetric decryption.
